# ASAR
Animal search and rescue
________________________________________________________________________________

## This python notebook is heavily directed towards the reasearch of the algorithm that can be used to solve the problem 
### The algos that i have used in this are
- logestic regression 
- multinomialNB
- gausianNB
- Random forest
- linearSVC
### Then also used pre built models and fine tuned it with my dataset and again used the following algos to get results the pre builds were
- Glove50d
- Glove100d
- Glove200d
- Glove300d
- GoogleNews Word2Vector

#### The accuracy isnt that great at all cause the dataset wasnt a very good dataset as the complaints werent equally distributed as a rsult convergence coudnt be    #### reached properly for many complaints 

All this brought me to the conclusion of which algo or model was best suited for my dataset 

## The next step
- Build a local dataset by using local complaints for animal search and rescue
