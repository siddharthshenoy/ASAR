# ASAR
# Animal Search And Rescue
________________________________________________________________________________

## This python notebook is heavily directed towards the reasearch of the algorithm that can be used to solve the problem 
### The algos that i have used in this are
- Logestic regression 
- MultinomialNB
- GausianNB
- Random forest
- LinearSVC
### Then also used pre built models and fine tuned it with my dataset and again used the following algos to get results the pre builds were
- Glove50d
- Glove100d
- Glove200d
- Glove300d
- GoogleNews Word2Vector

#### The accuracy isnt that great at all cause the dataset wasnt a very good dataset as the complaints werent equally distributed as a rsult convergence coudnt be    reached properly for many complaints 

All this brought me to the conclusion of which algo or model was best suited for my dataset 

## The next step
- Build a local dataset by using local complaints for animal search and rescue 



## New Data set was created
- The new build gives an accuracy of 84% to 96% which is the best we could produce as we had to prepare data from scratch
- The new model have already been pickled and provides with MAIN in their titles
- The Main program have been uploaded with the name as MAIN.ipynb

### At the end I would like to thank Aratrika,Akhil and Rollin to help me out to finish this project
